- precalculate opening positions
- test random play evaluation
- gradually relax limits
- different limits for batches (based on color?)
- dual circuit
- if a winning connection is detected after the opponent moves, then ...
  - investigate if this happens
- fix slowdown when moving back and forth in history
- zero window for alpha-beta/PVS
- swapAllowed is overridden by game
- dynamic width: until Rb and Rw are both dominated
- Carrier::new/delete
- Carrier size dynamic
- randomize play
- maxInOrRule should vary: 4-ALL
- 3d graphics
- show thinking with piece(s) of principal variation
- discard dominated moves
- fill board
- design hex protocol
- advanced clock handling
- ponder (think on opponents turn)
- integrate game tree search and H-search
- hex variants: chameleon, Y

Done:
- do not think much when there is only one move
- proper alpha-beta
- detect dead groups
- detect useless moves
- discard useless moves
- test transposition tables: doesn't help noticably with 20x20x20
- test iterative deepening:
  - memory hog
  - does not improve move ordering
- computer resign support
